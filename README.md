# BikeSeatDriver
## ECE411 Practicum Project - Team T13

BikeSeatDriver is a device that syncs to your smart phone in order to give you visual turn-by-turn direction on your bicycle. See our  [project proposal](https://github.com/htylo/ece411/wiki/Project-Proposal) for details.

This project is still in infancy. Please see [the project's wiki](https://github.com/htylo/ece411/wiki) for ongoing discussion on the project.
